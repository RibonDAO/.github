Just follow the contribution flow :D

## Some attention points
* Make sure the entire file is covered.
To do so, you can run yarn testCoverage and see if the file you're updating or creating has 100%.
* We have a testUtils with our custom functions. 
Don't forget to use them in place of "testing-library/react" functions.
* Feel free to add new tests and new functions that were not used yet.
